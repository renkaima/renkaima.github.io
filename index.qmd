Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati's [School of Information Technology](https://cech.uc.edu/schools/it.html). I was a postdoctoral scholar at [Vanderbilt University's Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/), advised by [Dr. Pamela J. Wisniewski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3JZB10QAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2025. I completed my Ph.D. in Informatics (Human-Computer Interaction) at Pennsylvania State University's [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) in 2024, advised by [Dr. Yubo Kou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mCz8znkAAAAJ&hl=en).

**ðŸ”¬My research: Trust and safety** (T&S) enacts the practices, policies, and technological implementations that create secure and trustworthy environments to shield users from harms, such as scams, harassment, and inappropriate content when using digital technolgies (e.g., GenAI, social media). As an interdisciplinary scholar, I use **a human-centered approach to address three areas of T&S**:

    "text": "Content Creator like YouTuber or Influencers on Instagram nowadays could be a profitable job for many people who aim to earn money (advertising income from YouTube or Creator Fund from TikTok) from their content creation and sharing. However, being content creators does not mean absolute freedom of content creation, and also, making money on platforms does not indicate secure employment.\nThat is because creators live in creator moderation, where multiple sociotechnical mechanisms exert control beyond creators’ content to their careers such as income, visibility, audience engagement and more. For example, if YouTube deems a video is not advertiser friendly, it will place limited or no ads on this video. Then, creator will receive decreased or nearly no money from such video because they underperformed in viewing times, watching hours, and audience engagement. Even creators’ fanbase increment will be negatively impacted.\nCurrently, I have gained understanding of (1) the socioeconomic implications of creator moderation on creators, a paper published in CSCW’ 2021; (2) the perceived unfairness of moderation decision-making and algorithms, a CSCW’ 2022 paper; and (3) organizational bureaucracy challenge, where creators need to negotiate for their self-interests, a CSCW’ 2022 poster."

    "text": "This is a study of human implications of online moderation systems that deal with disruptive online behaviors, such as offensive language and hate speech, by issuing penalties such as content removal or account suspension to users they determine to be disruptive. These moderation systems usually fail to provide punished users enough support in terms of explaining why they are punished and suggesting how they can improve. Such severe limitations in fairness, accountability, and transparency lead to enormous challenges to online moderation and community wellbeing.\n\nFor more details, please see Dr. Yubo Kou’s NSF funding page."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "Millions of users are now integrating AI companions into their daily lives. Unlike conventional, rule-based AI conversational agents, these companions offer conversations designed to feel personal and meaningful. AI companions like Character.AI (C.AI) exemplify this trend, but a new category of risk is emerging as millions of teens engage with companions designed to form deep social and emotional relationships. While youth can perceive them as supportive friends, they can also introduce severe risks, and the regulatory landscape remains unsettled.\nOur foundational work in this area analyzed user-reported risks across seven major LLM chatbots, finding that risks are highly platform-specific and revealing significant gaps between lab-based studies and the problems users encounter in the real world (read the preprint on arXiv). This early research highlights the need for more user-centered approaches to AI safety.\nBuilding on this, our current work focuses on understanding the nuanced ways youth experience AI companions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As online platforms evolve, moderation remains paramount, not just for filtering inappropriate content but also to prevent children from being exposed to targeted ads and unjust data tracking. Historically, research efforts have concentrated on general child safety with a limited exploration into the direct implications for creators and audiences, especially concerning regulations like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our first exploratory study on YouTube’s “made for kids” (MFK) classification, published in DIS ’24, brought to light the challenges creators and audiences face in protecting children’s data privacy, revealing how intertwined classification systems can hinder the effectiveness of content moderation.\nBuilding on this, we conducted a survey study to probe parental mediation in children’s online safety across platforms. Published in CHI ’25, this work juxtaposes parents’ definitions of harmful content against platform policies. We found that parents perform a complex benefit-harm analysis, and we proposed strategies for enhancing parents’ self-efficacy and platform-parent collaboration.\nThe next phase of this project involves participatory design workshops to support creators in enhancing child safety. Leveraging insights from our prior study on cross-platform creators published in CHI ’23, this ongoing study gathers content creators, moderators, policy experts, and parents. The aim is clear: ensure content safety for children, support creators without breaching policies, and understand how best to implement these moderation policies. Our work underscores the nuanced contextualization of online child safety in creator moderation and will present pivotal policy and design recommendations."

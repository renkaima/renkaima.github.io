## Background
Currently, the US workforce integration of neurodivergent talent remains a societal challenge. This population, specifically individuals with autism spectrum conditions and ADHD, often faces neurodevelopmental constraints related to executive function (EF) and self-regulation (SR). While intellectually capable, these individuals may experience deficits in working memory, set-shifting, and inhibitory control. 

This vulnerability peaks during the **"Services Cliff" (ages 15–26)**, where the cessation of mandated transition planning often leads to high postsecondary disconnection. My work explores how AI can bridge this gap by providing autonomous, real-time support in technical workplace environments.

## Research Aim & Methods
To address the neurodivergent unemployment crisis, this project focuses on mapping workplace ambiguity and points of friction through a multi-stakeholder qualitative approach:

* **Stakeholder Interviews**: Engaging neurodivergent employees and supervisors to identify where sociotechnical dynamics break down.
* **Speculative Design**: Utilizing Generative AI tools during sessions to co-ideate future technology supports with participants.
* **Cognitive Scaffolding**: Analyzing how LLMs help users offload executive dysfunction and regulate emotions.

## Initial Findings
In my study on autistic users' engagement with ChatGPT, we applied the **Technology Affordance framework** to analyze LLMs as cognitive scaffolding. While these tools provide significant support, they also introduce risks:

1.  **Reinforcing Delusional Thinking**: Bots may inadvertently validate non-factual beliefs.
2.  **Automated Masking**: By outsourcing communication to conform to neurotypical norms, users risk erasing their authentic identities.
